add Lsq_v3, and Dorefa and Pact, [https://github.com/ZouJiu1/Lsq_v3_Dorefa_Pact](https://github.com/ZouJiu1/Lsq_v3_Dorefa_Pact)<br>

add torch.nn.Parameter .data, retrain models 18-01-2022<br>

I'm not the author, I just complish an unofficial implementation of LSQ+ or LSQplus and LSQ，the origin paper you can find LSQ+ here [arxiv.org/abs/2004.09576](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09576) and LSQ here [arxiv.org/abs/1902.08153](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08153).<br>

pytorch==1.8.1<br>

You should train 32-bit float model firstly, then you can finetune a low bit-width quantization QAT model by loading the trained 32-bit float model<br>

Dataset used for training is CIFAR10 and model used is Resnet18 revised<br>

## Version introduction
lsqplus_quantize_V1.py: initialize s、beta of activation quantization according to LSQ+ [LSQ+: Improving low-bit quantization through learnable offsets and better initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09576)<br><br>
lsqplus_quantize_V2.py: initialize s、beta of activation quantization according to min max values<br><br>
lsqquantize_V1.py：initialize s of activation quantization according to LSQ [Learned Step Size Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08153)<br><br>
lsqquantize_V2.py: initialize s of activation quantization = 1<br><br>
lsqplus_quantize_V2.py has the best result when use cifar10 dataset<br>

## The Train Results

A represent activation, I use moving average method to initialize s and beta.<br><br>
